# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System  

A machine learning–based recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences.  
The project implements **Collaborative Filtering (KNN)** and **Deep Learning (AutoEncoder)** approaches for personalized movie recommendations.  

---

## 🚀 Features  

- 📊 **Data Preprocessing Pipeline** – Handles encoding, scaling, and train-test split.  
- 🎥 **Movie Recommendations** – Suggests movies tailored to user tastes.  
- 🤖 **Two Approaches:**  
  - **Collaborative Filtering (KNN)** – Uses similarity between users/items.  
  - **Deep Learning (AutoEncoder)** – Learns latent features for recommendations.  
- 💾 **Model Saving/Loading** – Efficient deployment with Pickle.  
- 🌐 **Streamlit Web App** – Interactive UI for searching and viewing recommendations.  
- 🎶 **Extra** – (Optional) Fetches posters or details via external APIs.

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
cd Movie-Recommendation-System

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run the Web App
streamlit run app.py

4️⃣ Example Output

Input: User likes Inception, Interstellar

Output: Recommended Movies → The Matrix, Tenet, Gravity

📊 Results

KNN Model: Achieves recommendations based on user similarity.

AutoEncoder Model: Captures hidden features and improves accuracy.

Streamlit App: Provides an easy-to-use interface.

🔮 Future Enhancements

✅ Add content-based filtering using movie metadata (genres, cast, director).

✅ Hybrid system combining collaborative + content filtering.

✅ Deploy on Heroku / AWS / GCP.

✅ Include user authentication for personalized recommendations.
